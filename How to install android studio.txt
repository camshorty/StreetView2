First download android studio for your computer (pc or mac)

follow the instructions, dont change the components (SDK and Virtual)

Choose where to store android studio and then the SDK (default is easy)

Start android studio

Follow instructions, click next for SDK components setup

Click Finish.

It will download stuff.

Create a new project

call it anything

now you need to choose the minimum sdk level (IE ice cream sandwich)

Best to make it lower than whatever you are using

Make a basic activity

Call it whatever

As far as im aware you can copy and paste the code from our java to your java
and the activity xml to your activity xml and it should build.
