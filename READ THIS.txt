Hello ALF

This is Cameron

MapsActivity.java

and 

activity_maps.xml

These are the two important files

Copy and paste the contents into corresponding java and xml files

I have also written down how to install android studio and create a project that can be copied into

This will have to do for now until we figure out how to copy an entire build across github

When you are ready you will need to plug your device into your computer and click run (>) and choose your device *not an emulated device
